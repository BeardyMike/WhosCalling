# WhosCalling
Takes the incoming caller number from 3CX and searches it online, using Google, Bing, or QuickBase-CRM.
Written entirely in AHK, this project fits a very specific needs for my office.

# Choose your preferred Browser & Search Engine
using the TrayMenuApplet you can customise the search engine and browser that you prefer to use. the Browser list only shows you options for the compatible browsers you have installed.

# Fully automated 3CX configuration changes
When you open and close the TrayMenuApplet it will change the 3CX config files and restart the app for you. 
The TrayMenuApplet isn't fussy about where it's stored or launched from, so long as the 3CX app has been installed in a normal way.
