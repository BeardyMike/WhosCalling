Takes the incoming caller number from 3CX and searches it online, using Google, Bing, or QuickBase-CRM.
Written entirely in AHK, this project fits a very specific need for my office and my workflow.

# Choose your preferred Browser & Search Engine
Using the TrayMenuApplet you can customise the search engine and browser to one you prefer to use. the Browser list only shows you options for the compatible browsers you have installed. This menu is found by right clicking the icon in the Windows start bar tray

# Fully automated 3CX configuration changes
When you open and close the TrayMenuApplet it will change the 3CX config files and restart the app for you. 
The TrayMenuApplet isn't fussy about where it's stored or launched from, so long as the 3CX app has been installed in a normal way.

# SMHotKey has been merged into this project

SMHotKey has been cleaned up and brought into this git, as I use the two for professional purposes. If the featureset grows or requires lots of updates, I may break it out to its own git. But for now, it's a part of WhosCalling.
